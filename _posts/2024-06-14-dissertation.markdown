My PhD dissertation, titled "Spectrum awareness for next-generation networks" focuses on building tools and techniques to bridge spectrum awareness into communication networks. Through my research, I show how these tools can be used to improve spectrum usage, spectrum regulation, and wireless security. Shoot me an email if you want a copy.
