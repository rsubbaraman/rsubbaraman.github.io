Open sourced an easy-to-use and set-up LoRa testbed developed as an offshoot from BSMA! If you are working on LoRa PHY or MAC layer research and need a testbed to test your systems, consider using this one! It works with all arduino-compatible devices and provides hooks into almost all PHY and MAC parameters.
