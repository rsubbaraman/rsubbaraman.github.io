This work develops BSMA, a scalable LoRa MAC protocol that uses full duplex gateways to improve network capacity by 100% compared to CSMA in bursty loads. Implementing BSMA requires a full duplex LoRa gateway, which we develop in the 915 MHz ISM band. The implementation of a LoRa BSMA gateway is open source, and works with COTS LoRA devices.
